# Assignment 2

Implementation of a simple note taker application through Flask. The app has basic functionality from Assignment 1 of adding a note, listing all notes, searching for a key word among all notes, and seeing the content of a note. It also has new features, allowing comments, showing time and date of comments and notes, and allowing deletion of a note and all its comments.

This app requires the following dependencies to run:
```bash
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-migrate
```

Then use the following command to run the app:
```bash
python run.py
```
